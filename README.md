# Vio: A Micro Reactive JavaScript Framework

Vio is a lightweight and reactive JavaScript framework designed for building dynamic user interfaces on the frontend. With its minimalistic approach, Vio empowers developers to create custom pages using templates and components, following a syntax inspired by Handlebars.

## Features

- **Micro Framework**: Vio is designed to be minimalistic, allowing developers to focus on building their applications without unnecessary overhead.
  
- **Reactive Architecture**: Vio utilizes a reactive architecture, meaning that changes in data automatically propagate to the user interface, ensuring a seamless and responsive experience.

- **Template-based**: Developers can create reusable templates using a syntax similar to Handlebars, making it easy to structure UI components and maintain consistency across the application.

- **Component-based**: Vio encourages a component-based approach to UI development, allowing developers to encapsulate functionality and design into reusable components that can be easily composed to build complex interfaces.

## Getting Started

To get started with Vio, follow these steps:

    ```

2. Navigate to the `vio` folder containing the framework implementation.

3. Explore the example project under the `src` folder to understand how to use Vio in your own projects.
